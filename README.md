# League Tracker (NodeJS)


## Goal
This project is designed to be a cleaner, faster, more extensible version of the
original PhP project hosted at [Wolven531.com](http://www.wolven531.com/league/).

## Development
During development, to avoid affecting the main site, all precautions will be
taken to hit the Riot API as infrequently as possible. If the project is currently
running, it will be available at
[c9 League Tracker](https://league-tracker-node-c9-wolven531.c9.io/).
